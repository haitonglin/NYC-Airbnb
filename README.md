New York City Airbnb Data Analysis and Predictions

This is a class project for a intro-level data science course. This project analyzes the 2019 New York City Airbnb open data. We want to find out the most popular places in NYC and see what's special about them. After basic analysis, we decided that we want to use Machine Learning algorithms to make predictions on an Airbnb's popularity, which is represented by the number of reviews. With features like locations, price, room type, etc., we used KNN and Decision Tree Classifier to make predictions, and we also did parameter tuning and data visualization, which gives relatively satisfying results.

The data of Airbnb in New York City has some very interesting patterns: private rooms are more popular, rooms in Manhattan are more expensive, et cetera. Among these we can see that for the people trying to start an Airbnb in NYC, it is very important for them to take features like price and avaliability into consideration. As we can observe obvious patterns in KNN predictions and the accuracy between KNN and Decision Tree Classifier (consider more features) are not very different, we can say that price and availability are two of the most important factors that decide whether the Airbnb will be popular.
